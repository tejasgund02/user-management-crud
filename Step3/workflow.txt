Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) – Persistent data store

Redis – Caching and queue handling

Queue Worker – Runs background jobs

Object Storage (S3/Azure Blob) – File handling and uploads

CI/CD Flow
Push to Git triggers the GitLab pipeline

Docker image gets built

Tests run automatically

Deploys to staging

Manual or automatic promotion to production

Benefits

Rollbacks are fast thanks to versioned Docker images

CI/CD makes releases faster and less error‑prone
